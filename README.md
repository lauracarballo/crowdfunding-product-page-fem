# Crowdfunding Product Page - Frontend Mentor

I built this crowdfunding product page following the Frontend Mentor design and styling guidances.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the [design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR) as possible.

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked
